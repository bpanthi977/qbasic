# light 

**LIGHT.BAS**

Visualize refraction of light at plane boundries. The program reads a data file (in text format) that has info on the objects (their position, refractive index, ...) and the rays to send. The file can also contain optional instruction/notes. See help.txt to find how to create such files (2prism.obj, beaker1.obj, beaker2.obj, ...). 

After the program starts provide the name of data file. e.g.  beaker1.obj then enjoy. :)
